        Different Species of Animals
    </h4>

    <p><b>Amphibians</b> are small vertebrates that need water, or a moist environment, to survive. The species in this group include frogs, toads, salamanders, 
        and newts. All can breathe and absorb water through their very thin skin. Amphibians also have special skin glands that produce useful proteins.
        Amphibians are a class of cold-blooded vertebrates made up of frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians.

    <p><b>Birds</b> are vertebrate animals that have feathers, wings, and beaks. Like all vertebrates, they have bony skeleton. Most birds are able to fly, 
        but some (like ostriches and penguins) cannot fly even though they still have wings. Birds are important members of many ecosystems. 
        They play a vital role in controlling pests, acting as pollinators, and maintaining island ecology.

    <p><b>Mammals</b> are vertebrates with hair, mammary glands used to suckle young with milk, a diaphragm, three bones in the middle ear, 
          and a lower jaw made up of a single pair of bones that articulates in a unique way with the skull. Mammals include humans and all other animals 
         (vertebrates have backbones) with hair. They feed their young with milk and have a more well-developed brain than other types of animals.

    <p><b>Reptiles</b> are cold-blooded vertebrates. (Vertebrates have backbones.) They have dry skin covered with scales or bony plates and usually lay 
    soft-shelled eggs. Reptiles run, crawl, climb, jump, glide and swim. Exceptional species run on the surface of water or “swim” through dry sand. 
    Reptiles need their eggs to stay dry, so they lay their eggs on land. Some reptiles will bury their eggs in sand or dirt to keep them safe.
